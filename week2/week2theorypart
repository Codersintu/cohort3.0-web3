How Blockchains do auth========If you ever want to create an account on a blockchain, you need to generate a public-private keypair.
<!--  -->
Public Key: The public key is a string that can be shared openly.
<!--  -->
Private key: The private key is a secret string that must be kept confidential.

What is a Bit?
A bit is the smallest unit of data in a computer and can have one of two values: 0 or 1.
Think of a bit like a light switch that can be either off (0) or on (1)

What is a byte?
A byte is a group of 8 bits. It’s the standard unit of data used to represent a single character in memory. Since each bit can be either 0 or 1, a byte can have 2^8 (256) possible values, ranging from 0 to 255

<!--  -->
Array of bytes
const bytes = [202, 244, 1, 23]
console.log(bytes);
<!--  -->
<!--  -->
UInt8Array
A better way to represent an array of bytes is to use a UInt8Array in JS
let bytes = new Uint8Array([0, 255, 127, 128]);
console.log(bytes)

Why use UInt8Array over native arrays ?***
((1))=They use less space. Every number takes 64 bits (8 bytes). But every value in a UInt8Array takes 1 byte.

((2))=UInt8Array Enforces constraints - It makes sure every element doesn’t exceed 255.

Encodings***
Bytes are cool but highly unreadable. Imagine telling someone
Hey, my name is 00101011101010101020
It’s easier to encode data so it is more human readable . Some common encodings include - 
1.Ascii
2.Hex
3.Base64
4.Base58

1.Ascii
  1 character = 7 bits
